Welcome to my personal website! I am a graduate student in the [Department of Astronomy](https://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/people/walter-will-golay) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) and a member of the [Center for Astrophysics \| Harvard & Smithsonian](https://cfa.harvard.edu/people/will-golay). I am part of the [Cosmic Transients Lab](https://www.transients.science/) advised by [Professor Edo Berger](https://scholar.harvard.edu/eberger/home). Additionally, I am a supporting member of the [Macalester-Augustana-Coe Robotic Observatory](https://macroconsortium.org/) (MACRO) Consortium. I completed my undergraduate degree in physics and astronomy at the [University of Iowa](https://physics.uiowa.edu/) where my research was advised by [Professor Robert Mutel](https://www.physics.uiowa.edu/people/robert-mutel). Previously, I was a summer intern in the [Cosmic Microwave Background Lab](https://cfa.harvard.edu/facilities-technology/cfa-facilities/kovac-cmb-lab) in the [CfA REU Program](https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/opportunities/graduate-undergraduate-programs/reu-summer-intern-program) where I worked with [Professor John Kovac](https://astronomy.fas.harvard.edu/people/john-m-kovac) and [Dr. Clara Verg√®s](https://claraverges.github.io/) on the [BICEP/Keck Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array) experiment.

In my research, I focus on the lowest energy light on the electromagnetic spectrum, often called [radio astronomy](https://public.nrao.edu/radio-astronomy/the-science-of-radio-astronomy/) or centimeter/millimeter/sub-millimeter astronomy. I use [interferometry](https://public.nrao.edu/interferometry-explained/) to combine the signals from multiple radio telescopes to create a virtual telescope the size of the distance between the telescopes. I use radio telescopes like the [National Radio Astronomy Observatory](https://public.nrao.edu/) [Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array](https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/vla/) (VLA) located in Socorro, New Mexico, which has 27 antennas in a Y-shaped configuration. I also observe with the [Very Long Baseline Array](https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/vlba/) (VLBA) composed of ten antennas spread across the United States from Hawaii to the Virgin Islands to create the highest resolution images in astronomy using a technique called [Very Long Baseline Interferometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-long-baseline_interferometry). I also use the [Submillimeter Array](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/sma/) located near the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii which operates at the highest frequencies of radio astronomy.

Using these telescopes and others, I observe some of the most energetic events in the universe. Currently, [I am monitoring](https://www.wis-tns.org/astronotes/astronote/2023-266) several [tidal disruption events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_disruption_event) which occur when a star passes too close to a supermassive black hole and is torn apart by the black hole's gravity. I am also interested in radio observations of other kinds of transient events like [supernovae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova), [gamma-ray bursts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst), and [fast blue optical transients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_blue_optical_transient).

I am also interested in the magnetic fields of stars and how they affect stellar evolution, stellar winds, and using them to uncover star-planet interactions. I began work on this topic during my undergraduate research where I observed a suite of radio stars with the VLA at multiple frequencies to determine how their radio emission is produced (ref. [Golay et al. 2023](/files/ThermalGS_Final.pdf)). In my second project, I focused in on one binary star system called [HR1099](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HR_1099), where I used the VLBA to observe at very high resolution. We were able to map how the radio emission follows the binary's orbit: check out [this movie](/files/HR1099_movie.mp4) of our observations (ref. [Golay et al. 2024](/files/HR1099_Preprint.pdf)). Now, I am focusing on modeling how certain stars produce radio "masers" (like a laser, but with microwaves) and observations of exoplanet-hosting stars to search for radio emission from star-planet interactions.

I am also interested in the automation of small telescopes for undergraduate research and educational use. I am the primary author of the pure-Python package [pyscope](https://pyscope.readthedocs.io/), which provides a simple interface to control astronomical instrumentation and is built on the [ASCOM](https://ascom-standards.org/) standard for easy integration with popular, commercially-available hardware. Observatories using [pyscope](https://pyscope.readthedocs.io/) can take advantage of the [telrun](https://pyscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/pyscope.telrun.html) module for fully-robotic operation. This work is part of the [MACRO Consortium](https://macroconsortium.org/) which operates a 0.5m PlaneWave CDK telescope at the [Winer Observatory](https://www.winer.org/) in Sonoita, Arizona.
