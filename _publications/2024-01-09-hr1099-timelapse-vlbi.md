We report multi-epoch astrometric VLBI observations of the chromospherically active binary HR 1099 (V711 Tau, HD 22468) at six epochs over 63 days using the Very Long Baseline Array at 22.2 GHz. We determined hourly radio centroid positions at each epoch with a positional uncertainty significantly smaller than the component separation. The aggregate radio positions at all epochs define an ellipse in the co-moving reference frame with an inclination i=39.5 (+3.6 -3.5) degr and longitude of ascending node Omega=212+/-22 degr. The ellipse center is offset from the Third Gaia Celestial Reference Frame position by -0.81 (+0.25 -0.37) mas, 0.45 (+0.23 -0.25) mas. All radio centroids are well-displaced from the binary center of mass at all epochs, ruling out emission from the inter-binary region. We examined the motion of the radio centroids within each epoch by comparing hourly positions over several hours. The measured speeds were not statistically significant for five of the six epochs, with 2 sigma upper limits in the range 200-1000 km/sec. However, for one flaring epoch, there was a ~3 sigma detection v=228+/-75 km/s. This speed is comparable to the mean speed of observed coronal mass ejections on the Sun.
